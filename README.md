# Certificate Manager App

The **Certificate Manager App** is designed to manage certificates within an organization where a user can track certificate validity, certificate assigned users
certificate supplier, and you can be able to add comments on a specific certificate. 

The app uses a **Maven multi-module structure**, with **Quarkus** for backend and **React** for the frontend. Database schema changes are managed with **Liquibase**.
